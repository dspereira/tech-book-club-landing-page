## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid Layout
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was built using vanilla HTML and CSS, with special attention to semantics to improve accessibility.
This project was implemented using a CSS Grid Layout to improve responsiveness. The page adapts depending on the device—whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile—by being divided into responsive columns. This division into columns allows precise placement of each element, making them responsive according to the changes in column sizes.
More information about the column division and calculations can be found [here](https://github.com/dspereira/tech-book-club-landing-page/blob/main/grid-layout-calculations.md).
