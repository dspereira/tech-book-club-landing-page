## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid Layout
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project was built using vanilla HTML and CSS, with special attention to semantics to improve accessibility.
This project was implemented using a CSS Grid Layout to improve responsiveness. The page adapts depending on the device—whether it's a desktop, tablet, or mobile—by being divided into responsive columns. This division into columns allows precise placement of each element, making them responsive according to the changes in column sizes.
More information about the column division and calculations can be found [here](https://github.com/dspereira/tech-book-club-landing-page/blob/main/grid-layout-calculations.md).
